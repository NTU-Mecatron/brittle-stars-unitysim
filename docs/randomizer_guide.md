Everything we've created to enable this particular Project lives inside the Assets folder, which you can locate in the Project Browser panel.

## The Unity Scene
We have made one example scene called `OutdoorsScene`. You can create your own scene, but it is recommended that you understand this scene first.

### Simulation Scene
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9ce1bb2-5d8a-4203-802b-65a28237b43f)

The Simulation Scene has a few randomizers:
- [BackgroundObjectPlacementRandomizer](#backgroundobjectplacementrandomizer). Randomize the shape of seabed during synthetic data generation.
- [TextureRandomizer](#texturerandomizer). Randomize the seabed during synthetic data generation.
- [ForegroundObjectPlacementRandomizer](#foregroundobjectplacementrandomizer). Randomize the pictures of brittle stars during synthetic data generation.
- [RotationRandomizer](#rotationrandomizer). Randomize the angle of brittle stars picture during synthetic data generation.
- [MyLightRandomizer](#mylightrandomizer). Randomize the direction of light during synthetic data generation.
- [ForegroundScaleRandomizer](#foregroundscalerandomizer). Randomize the size of brittle stars pictures during synthetic data generation.


### GameObject
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/625e5f5b-b7ff-410d-b02b-4a1848f63072)

This game object has a volume with `Motion Blur` attached to it. It is created to avoid motion blur when the refresh rate that are set is too high.

## Randomizers
The randomizers are implemented here in order to generate various combinations of brittle stars layouts with different seabeds.
> Note: For proper setup guide of randomizers, please refer to the [Unity Perception Tutorial 1](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception/blob/main/com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Tutorial/Phase1.md) and [Unity Perception Tutorial 2](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception/blob/main/com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Tutorial/Phase2.md)

### BackgroundObjectPlacementRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ea983a-9230-47a9-9c8c-912ff52e7e7a)
This randomizer will scatter different shapes of seabeds at the background of the camera view. Here, we are using the Prefabs provided in the sample folder of perception.
- **游릭 Action**: Click _**Add Folder**_, and from the file explorer window that opens, choose the folder which prefabs needed are stored. In this project, we use the sample prefabs in `Assets/Samples/Perception/<Perception Package Version>/Tutorial Files/Background Objects/Prefabs`.
- **游릭 Action**: Set the rest of the properties of `Depth`, `Layer Count`, `Separation Distance` and `Placement Area` according to your preferences. The parameters we used is  `Depth = 0, Layer Count = 2, Separation Distance = 0.7, Placement Area = (8,8)`.
The `Separation Distance` will define how crowded the prefabs of seabed are, while `Placement Area` will control the area of where prefabs of seabed will be scattered.

### TextureRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4aa4bdc-fd6e-4309-8863-24245663dd7f)
This randomizer will render the seabed pictures onto the background object that we scatter with **_BackgroundObjectPlacementRandomizer_**.
- **游릭 Action**: Click _**Add Folder**_, and from the file explorer window that opens, choose the folder which seabed pictures needed are stored. In this project, we use the images in `Assets\Background\Images`.

### ForegroundObjectPlacementRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5b605c-2f58-45a2-92a5-ad45c13409a5)
This randomizer will put the pictures of brittle stars scatter randomly in the camera view.
- **游릭 Action**: Click _**Add Folder**_, and from the file explorer window that opens, choose the folder which brittle star planes needed are stored. In this project, we use the prefabs in `Assets/Ophiorpidea/Prefabs`.
- **游릭 Action**: Set the rest of the properties of `Depth`, `Layer Count`, `Separation Distance` and `Placement Area` according to your preferences. The parameters we used is  `Depth = -3, Separation Distance = 1, Placement Area = (8,4)`.
The `Separation Distance` will define how crowded the prefabs of brittle stars are, while `Placement Area` will control the area of where prefabs of brittle stars will be scattered.

### RotationRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2d065aa-3384-4def-a0c9-6b817d0c9301)
This randomizer will flip the pictures of brittle stars to stimulate brittle stars on non-flat surfaces.
- **游릭 Action**: In the UI snippet for `RotationRandomizer`, verify that all the minimum values for the three ranges are `-10` and that maximum values are `10`.
If the rotation angle is too large, it will make the brittle stars look thinner, harder to be recoginized.

### MyLightRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218569a3-6acc-4d2f-93b2-022d1dce0d28)
This randomizer will change the direction of light in camera view.
- **游릭 Action**: In the UI snippet for `MyLightRandomizer`, verify that `Light Intensity = (0,2), Temperature = (3000,16000)`.

### ForegroundScaleRandomizer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44bb3912-d2a1-4062-9cd1-bb8af2e4edb9)
This randomizer will stimulate the size of brittle stars in the camera view.
- **游릭 Action**: In the UI snippet for `ForegroundScaleRandomizer`, verify that `X = (0.02,0.08), Y = (0.01,0.1), Z = (0.02,0.08)`.
